This article's main error is that the metric it uses to determine which programming language is best to learn is not very holistic; it is simply a ranking of how many job offerings there are for each programming language. Clearly topic is is highly subjective, but regardless, there are many cases in which high ranking languages on this list are objectively not ideal for an individual to learn. Let's observe a few those cases. 

### Case 1: You don't know any programming languages

In this case, Python, which is number one on the list, will be beneficial to you only in that it has a low learning curve, but beyond that, there isn't much that you can do with just python. You cannot make a mobile app, website, or game in python. At best you can make scripts for automation, or do data science, but you can make scripts with other programming languages, that have mor functionality, and if you want to be a data scientist, odds are that you'd be better off learning another more useful programming language first as well.

A similar argument can be made about SQL, which is number 2 on the list. SQL is a highly specialized language, made for working with databases, and therefore has limited functionality. Similar to python, you can't make applications with SQL alone, so learning only SQL doesn't provide much utility to you. 

That being said, Python and SQL are both excellent programming languages for a seasoned programmer to have in their back pocket, as they both provide tools to a programmer that very few other languages do. 

### Case 2: You know some programming languages

If you know some programming languages, but not Java, it really isn't worth learning. Java does everything, and it works on almost any computer, granted that it has the right files set up. However, if you know other object oriented languages, such as C++ or C#, then learning Java won't give you much utility you don't already have access to, and it won't give you much more opportunity either, since there is an abundance of programmers who know Java, due to the fact that it is often the language of choice in college level programming classes. 

However, if you don't know an object oriented language, it may be a good idea to learn Java, if there's something about it that you find interesting or useful, but there are other object oriented languages that run faster, and have more functionality, such as C++.

## Conclusion

Learning any programming language is useful, profitable, and often highly personally rewarding. However, the "best" language to learn for an individual varies greatly depending on what prior knowledge an individual has, and what they would like to do as a programmer.
