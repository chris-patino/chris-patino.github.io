# Hobbies

The following are a couple topics that I engage with regularly, although not as seriously as others.

## Languages

I'm currently studying the Japanese language, mostly for fun. I've learned the grammar and vocabulary for the JLPT N4, which is a test for basic Japanese, and I'm studying for the JLPT N3, which is a test for basic Japanese fluency, and after that I plan on studying for and taking the JLPT N2, and JLPT N1, which are test for business level fluency and higher business fluency respectively. I'm not sure if I'll ever use Japanese for something productive, such as working/ studying in Japan or an otherwise Japanese speaking workplace, but it's something that I highly enjoy learning more about, practicing, and using.

After I feel like my Japanese level is "good enough" for me to stop studying the language, I'll probably start learning Spanish to fill the hole in my schedule.

## Cybersecurity/ CTFs

This is another topic that I enjoy learning more about, although I admittedly haven't done much in terms of cybersecurity projects. I've read a couple of textbooks about cryptography, and solved some old CTF (capture the flag) problems, but mostly in the cryptography category. I'd be interested in joining a team, if there is any such team in need of a cryptography specialist, but for now I'm content as a mere observer, as my school work and other projects keep me more than busy enough.
