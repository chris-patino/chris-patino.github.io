# Hobbies

I have a variety of less serious interest outside of my academic and professional work.
PUT SOME MORE TEXT HERE

## Languages

I'm currently studying Japanese, mostly for fun. I'm studying for the JLPT N3, which is a test for basic Japanese fluency, and after that I plan on studying for and taking the JLPT N2, and JLPT N1, which are test for business level fluency and higher busines fluency respectively. I'm not sure if I'll ever use Japanese for something productive, such as working in Japan or an otherwise Japanese speaking workplace, but it's something that I highly enjoy learning more about, practicing, and using.

## Cybersecurity/ CTFs

This is another topic that I enjoy learning more about, although I admittedly haven't done much in terms of cybersecurity projects. I've read a couple of textbooks about cryptography, and solved some old CTf (capture the flag) problems, but mostly in the cryptography category. I'd be interesting in joining a team, if there is any such team in need of a cryptography specialist, but for now I'm content as a mere observer, as my school work and other projects keep me more than busy enough.
