## About me

Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Chris Patino, I am a third year undergrad student at UC San Diego studying applied mathemtics. I started teaching myself how to program in high school, fell in love with it, and started studying computer engineering at community college after graduating highschool. Not long after that I became interested in cryptography, read a variety of text books on the subject, and switched my major to applied math in order to acquire the theoretical foundations required to do research in cryptography. Due to this shift and independent study, I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages such as C/C++, Java, MIPS Assembly, and Python, as well as mathematical fields that are not covered in a traditional computer science education, such as real analysis and abstract algebra. The synergy between my computer science education and my applied math education has become one of my greatest assets professionally.

I'm not entriely sure what I'd like to do after graduating. I may work in some cybersecurity/ programming related job, if I find the right opportunity. Otherwise, I'll likely go to gradschool to study something related to math, computer science, or cyber security.
